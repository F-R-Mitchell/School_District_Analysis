# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the original analysis was to determine the performance of schools within the district based on multiple factors. Performance of the school is determined by reading and math scores which was further broken down into average scores per grade. The factors are budget per student, school size, and type of school. Unfortunately, the ninth grade students within Thomas High School have been suspected of academic dishonesty concerning their math and reading scores. Due to the academic dishonesty, the school board would like to run the original analysis but to remove the ninth grade class.
