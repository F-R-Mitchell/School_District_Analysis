# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the original analysis was to determine the performance of schools within the district based on multiple factors. Performance of the school is determined by reading and math scores which was further broken down into average scores per grade. The factors are budget per student, school size, and type of school. Unfortunately, the ninth grade students within Thomas High School have been suspected of academic dishonesty concerning their math and reading scores. Due to the academic dishonesty, the school board would like to run the original analysis but to remove the ninth grade class.

## Results

The school summary drastically decreased due to removing the 9th grade class. As seen in the image, Thomas High School was one of the top performing schools. They had a high percentage of students passing math and reading.

This is compared to after removing the 9th grade class where the overall passing percentage decreased significantly. As seen in the image below, Thomas High School has lost their previously inflated overall passing percentage.
