# School_District_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the original analysis was to determine the performance of schools within the district based on multiple factors. Performance of the school is determined by reading and math scores which was further broken down into average scores per grade. The factors are budget per student, school size, and type of school. Unfortunately, the ninth grade students within Thomas High School have been suspected of academic dishonesty concerning their math and reading scores. Due to the academic dishonesty, the school board would like to run the original analysis but to remove the ninth grade class.

## Results

The district summary wasn't effected at all, the district summary with the 9th grade class is identical to the the summary without the class. As seen below, nothing has changed between the two analyses.

This is compared to after removing the 9th grade class where the overall passing percentage decreased significantly. As seen in the image below, Thomas High School has lost their previously inflated overall passing percentage.
